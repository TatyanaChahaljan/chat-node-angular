## Development frontend server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev angular server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build frontend

Run `npm run build` to build the angular project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
